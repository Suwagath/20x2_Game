# 20x2_Game
20x2 game recreated using Python.

The objective of the 20x2 game is to be the first player to reach the end of the
board before the other player does. The game is played on a 20x2 board, with
each player starting at the first position of the board. The game begins with each
player rolling a die, and the player who rolls the highest value goes first. To start
the game, a player must roll a six. Players take turns rolling the dice and moving
their pieces according to the number shown on the dice. If a player lands on a
black hole, they are sent back to the start of the board. The number of moves a
player can make is equal to half of the dice value. The game continues until one
player reaches the end of the board.
